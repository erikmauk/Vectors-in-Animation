# Vectors-in-Animation
Computational Art: Lab 7 (Tant de ForÃªts Animation)

In this lab, my instructor showed us a video that was a French environmental awareness video. 
From it, I chose one scene to recreate.

I used vectors to move each of the birds in my scene with x and y coordinates, following sine waves.
Like I have done in a lot of my labs/projects, I made a function to draw one bird and had them randomly 
created with varying body color, two tone beak color, and had leaves randomly placed as well.

Within this repository, you will find a demo video of the final product attached. Enjoy!
